            Human Rights First is an independent advocacy and action
            organization that challenges America to live up to its ideals. We
            believe American leadership is essential in the global struggle for
            human rights, so we press the U.S. government and private companies
            to respect human rights and the rule of law. When they fail, we step
            in to demand reform, accountability and justice. Around the world,
            we work where we can best harness American influence to secure core
            freedoms.
